<h3> <b>Good evening Webjam participants! </b> </h3>

This is a sample ToDo List fullstack app. Feel free to clone and mess around with it to try adding features/changing it around.
While just remixing this app would not be a valid submission for the WebJam, it's good practice!

Good luck, and feel free to ask me any questions through discord (or email: rroycho1@uci.edu)!
